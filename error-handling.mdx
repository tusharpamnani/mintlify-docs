Robust error handling is crucial for any production-ready application. Our `ShardeumAPI` class incorporates `try...catch` blocks around all network and wallet interactions.

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Wallet Not Found:** Prompt user to install MetaMask or another wallet extension.
2. **Wallet Connection Rejected:** User declined wallet connection; show a clear message.
3. **Transaction Rejected by User:** User declined to sign the transaction; handle gracefully.
4. **RPC Errors:** Inspect the `error` object in the RPC response for details.
5. **Network Errors:** Catch and display network issues (e.g., endpoint down, no internet).

By handling these cases, your app will be more resilient and user-friendly.
