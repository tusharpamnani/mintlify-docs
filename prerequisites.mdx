Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend an LTS (Long Term Support) version.
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes bundled with Node.js.
- **MetaMask (or similar browser wallet):** Our example code is designed for a browser environment where a wallet like MetaMask injects `window.ethereum`. This is essential for user authentication and transaction signing.
- **Basic JavaScript knowledge:** Familiarity with `async/await`, classes, and ES6 modules will be helpful.

### Installing Dependencies

Our tutorial will primarily use the `ethers.js` library, which simplifies interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

```bash
mkdir shardeum-rpc-tutorial
cd shardeum-rpc-tutorial
npm init -y
npm install ethers
```
