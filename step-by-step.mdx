### Constructor
- Sets up the RPC URL, provider, signer, and transaction history.

### Connecting to Shardeum and Authentication
- Checks for `window.ethereum` (MetaMask or similar wallet).
- Requests account access and gets a signer for transactions.

### Performing a Sample Request: `eth_getBalance`
- Uses a raw JSON-RPC call to get an account's balance.
- Converts the result from Wei to SHM for readability.

### Sending Transactions: `sendSHM`
- Converts SHM to Wei, gets gas price, and sends a transaction using the signer.
- Handles user approval and transaction hash retrieval.

### Other Helper Functions
- `getCurrentAddress()`, `getMyBalance()`, `getGasPrice()`, `getTransactionByHash()`, `donate()`, `formatSHM()`, `parseSHM()`.

Each method is wrapped in robust error handling for a smooth developer experience.
