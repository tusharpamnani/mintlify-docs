title: Shardeum JSON-RPC Developer Guide
description: "Comprehensive guide to connecting and interacting with Shardeum via JSON-RPC."
---

Welcome, developers! This guide will help you connect to the Shardeum network using JSON-RPC, perform essential operations, and handle potential issues. We'll use `ethers.js` for wallet interactions and direct `fetch` calls for raw JSON-RPC requests, with practical, step-by-step examples.

## Introduction
Shardeum is an EVM-compatible blockchain designed for scalability. Like other Ethereum-based networks, it exposes its functionality via a JSON-RPC interface. This allows applications to interact with the blockchain, query data, send transactions, and more.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MetaMask** (or similar browser wallet)
- **Basic JavaScript knowledge**

Install dependencies:
```bash
mkdir shardeum-rpc-tutorial
cd shardeum-rpc-tutorial
npm init -y
npm install ethers
```
