Welcome, developers! This tutorial will guide you through connecting to the Shardeum network using JSON-RPC, performing essential operations, and handling potential issues. We'll leverage the powerful `ethers.js` library for wallet interactions and direct `fetch` calls for raw JSON-RPC requests, using a practical, step-by-step example.

**Why this guide?** While official documentation provides valuable information, sometimes a hands-on, clearly explained example makes all the difference. This tutorial aims to be that difference, breaking down the process into easily digestible parts.
