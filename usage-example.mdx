description: "A practical example of using the ShardeumAPI class in your project."
---

To use your `ShardeumAPI` class, create an `index.js` (or similar) file in your project:

```javascript
import shardeumAPI from './ShardeumAPI.js';

async function runExample() {
  // ... (see full example in the guide)
}
```

### How to Run This Example (Browser-based)

1. Save the `ShardeumAPI` class code as `ShardeumAPI.js`.
2. Save the example usage code as `index.js`.
3. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory (see the guide for a template).
4. Open `index.html` in your web browser with MetaMask installed.
5. Open your browser's developer console (F12).
6. Click the "Run Shardeum Example" button on the webpage.

You will see MetaMask pop up to request connection and then to confirm transactions. All output will be in your browser's console.
